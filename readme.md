# Repo for Bluetooth Light Monitor
## LM_bluetooth/
Contains source files for an STM32WB55 Nucleo board to act as a light monitor with Bluetooth Low-Energy support. Programs the wireless co-processor as a BLE Cable Replacement server, which is from the official STMicroelectronics GitHub (link [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/tree/master/Projects/P-NUCLEO-WB55.Nucleo/Applications/BLE/BLE_CableReplacement)).

A compiled binary for debugging on the board is provided at LM_bluetooth/Debug/.
